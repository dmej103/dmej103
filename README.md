### Hi there 👋

My name is David Mejia, an upper senior attending CUNY Queens College. Excited to keep honing my skills, and expanding my tech toolbox.

- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently working on preparing for hackathons and grinding leetcode.
- 📚 I’m currently learning Computer Vision, Data Mining, and Distributed Systems
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects in any multi-threaded languages (Java, C++, Python) or Javascript. I want to make complete full-stack applications to be hosted online.
- 💬 Ask me about Java. 
- 📫 How to reach me: _**davidmej1997@gmail.com**_
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love skateboarding, playing guitar and chess. If you skate as well, hit me up! it doesn't have to be strictly tech-related.
