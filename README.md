### Hi there 👋

My name is David Mejia, a lower senior attending CUNY Queens College. Excited to keep honing my skills, and expand my tech toolbox.

- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently working on a personal website to teach myself the React framework
- 📚 I’m currently learning Ruby on Rails, and HTML, CSS
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects in Python or Javascript. I want to make complete full-stack applications to be hosted online.
- 💬 Ask me about Python or Javascript projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: _**davidmej1997@gmail.com**_
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love skateboarding! If you skate as well, hit me up, it doesn't have to be strictly tech-related.
